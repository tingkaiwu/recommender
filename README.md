## Introduction

Recommender System is an interactive web application for job seekers to search and apply openings. 
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use J2EE to develop RESTful API. 
In addition, I also implemented a content-based  job recommender system to recommend jobs to users. 
I built RESTful APIs using Java Servlets to retrieve job description using GitHub API and store data in MySQL, 
and I use the MonkeyLearn API to extract the keywords of the job description. in order to build the Content-based algorithm.
